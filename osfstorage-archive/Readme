This repo contains the code to replicate the analyses in the paper.

The three R markdown files (one for each grammatical feature) use the replicate package to interweave the python and R code used to run the information bottleneck method, calculate statistics and render the plots in the paper. The markdown files make use of the data stored in the Data folder and the other python code.

Data/ : Raw data files about grammatical feature forms and meanings.

ck_blahut_arimoto.py : wrapper for the Information Bottleneck method from the dit python package

ibhelpers.py : helper functions for analysis
