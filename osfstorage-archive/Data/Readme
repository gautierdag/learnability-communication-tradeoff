The data files have the following format.

The tables have columns for Language, Family, Source and Comments. Then for each domain, the unique meaning partitions required to code the languages recieve a column. 
For number and evidentiality, the value of the partition columns signifies presence of the category.
For tense, the value of the partition columns is taken from Dahl (1985) and reflects how the partition is realized in the language (e.g., implicitly).

The form data have a separate format: Language, Meaning, Form.
For number there are two different files, NumberForms.csv contains the data we use in our analyses (nominal and pronominal forms). Number_Forms.csv contains a broader survey of how languages encode number information (e.g., subject-verb agreement).

        Form1: Romanized script removing punctuation
        Length: Number of characters of Form1


Forms.csv
    Specification::
